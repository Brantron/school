  <h1>My Time working on Team America Rocketry Challenge</h1>
  
<p>Team America Rocketry Challenge was the last website I built for Top Shelf Design. By this point I was not only leading projects, but I was leading the most complex projects we had and was even going along to meet the client for the initial project scope meetings. Before this project, I may be the lead on a project, but I wasn't yet trusted to know all of the technical questions that needed answering right up front.</p>

  <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
  <p>
<p>This was a massive project and really felt like a pressure cooker. We had very tight deadlines, a large build, and it was our newest, and largerst, client at the time. This project tought me how to interact with the Google Maps API as well as a bit about how to upsell a client on features they didn't know they wanted.</p>
