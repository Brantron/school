<p>DivvyCloud was a project I worked on for Top Shelf Design. This project was created using WordPress. I worked with one other developer to create this website. I have not worked on it in a long time so it is barely recognizable to when I did work on it.</p>

{% capture lessons %}
<p>One of the most interesting things I learned on this project was the complexity, and possibilities, of building animations using CSS and JavaScript. I built a complex animation using a JavaScript library called TweenMax that was awesome to work with. This project gave me a new appreciation for other forms of online animation that I saw.</p>
