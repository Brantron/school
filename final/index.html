  Hello, I'm a Front End Engineer. <br />To skip to my projects, please choose a page from the menu above. <br /><br />Since I started writing code, I have always jumped in head first. I honed my front end chops in a fast paced agency that delivered a lot of great work on tight deadlines. I built up more broad/advanced engineering skills by building the replacement for a legacy app which handles >3M visitors weekly and generates >$350M in revenue annually using the React Framework at my previous workplace, Custom Ink. Now you can find me at a startup called <a href="https://www.contactually.com">Contactually</a> working on an outstanding CRM for real estate professionals and others that leverage their network to drive their business.
